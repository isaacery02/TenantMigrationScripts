If the extension is BitLocker, then this should be disabled (reboot required) before performing the move operation.
Note: consider using Azure managed disks with SSE rather than BitLocker as an extension on the VM.

Types of Encryption and Migration Scenarios:
Azure Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with Platform-Managed Keys (PMKs):

Description: The disk is encrypted using keys managed by Azure.
Migration: Fully supported. You can move encrypted disks across subscriptions, resource groups, or even regions without any additional steps.
Steps:
Use Azure Portal, CLI, or PowerShell to move the disk or VM.
Azure Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs):

Description: The disk is encrypted using customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault.
Migration:
Supported, but you must ensure the Key Vault is accessible in the target subscription/region.
The target subscription/region must have access to the same Key Vault or the key must be replicated to a Key Vault in the target region.
Steps:
Verify Key Vault permissions in the target subscription/region.
Move the disk using Azure Portal, CLI, or PowerShell.
Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) with BitLocker or DM-Crypt:

Description: The OS or data disk is encrypted using BitLocker (Windows) or DM-Crypt (Linux).
Migration:
Within the same subscription: Supported with some restrictions.
Across subscriptions or regions: Generally not supported. You must disable encryption before migration.
Steps (if required):
Disable Azure Disk Encryption (this may require VM deallocation and decryption of the disk).
Perform the move operation.
Re-enable encryption after the move.
BitLocker Managed via Extensions:

Description: BitLocker is enabled as an extension on the VM.
Migration:
Not directly supported. The extension must be disabled before the move.
Steps:
Disable the BitLocker extension and reboot the VM.
Perform the migration.
Re-enable the extension after the move if required.
